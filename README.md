## I know
A quite a bit about Quantum Mechanics, Spinors, String Theory.

and practically a little bit about everything .w.

and last but not least

# I love science
## the rules of science
- Failure is just the beginning, not an end.
- everything can fail, and it's okay to be wrong.
- Assume nothing, question everything.
- Never stop learning

# be human, be kind, be loving, be embracing, be caring
What it means to be human, is to error, and grow from faults

and don't be like certain companies or organizations that follow the three E's
- **E**mbrace other competitors
- **E**xpand over vast distances to envelop everything that they had once enveloped.
- **E**xtinguish other competitions so that you may be the only "winner" standing, and get all the "fame" and "fortune" you so rigthfully do not deserve.

People who attempt, to rewrite history all so that only they can win or that only they are right, are not human.

They're not people.

They are nothing but cruel, torturous, monsters.

Who are nothing more than greedy, and as such, do not deserve a thing, they have.

Not everything has to be a competition, it is merely a shame that people think like that.

And even more so that society as it possibly once was, used to run that way, where only the winners, possibly the most awful people in life who made horrid choices, wrote history.

# But
Your life is yours to choose, as you only get to live once, live the way you want it.
If that's being the most horrid person on the planet? Then so be it.
